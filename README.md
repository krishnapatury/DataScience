## <a href="https://github.com/krishnapatury/DataScience/blob/main/KrishnaPatury_Malaria_Detection.ipynb" rel="nofollow">Malaria Detection</a> 
Malaria is a contagious disease caused by infected female Anopheles mosquitoes by parasites entering the blood and damaging red blood cells (RBCs) that carry oxygen. Late treatment can be fatal, with almost 50% of the worldâ€™s population in danger of malaria. In 2019, children accounted for 67% of all malaria deaths worldwide. Diagnosis in the laboratory depends heavily on human expertise in distinguishing infected cells from healthy cells and is time-consuming, and accuracy is affected by variability in manual classification. Automated tools might provide quicker and better results to help with early detection.

<b>Objective:</b>
Building an efficient computer vision model to identify whether a given image of a red blood cell is infected with malaria or not, and classify the same as parasitized or uninfected, respectively. Achieve faster results and better accuracy in malaria classification by reducing variability due to manual intervention.


## <a href="https://github.com/krishnapatury/DataScience/blob/main/DeepLearning_SVHN_Digit_Recognition.ipynb" rel="nofollow">Street View Housing Number Digit Recognition</a> 
One of the most interesting tasks in deep learning is to recognize objects in natural scenes. The Street View Housing Numbers (SVHN), a popular image recognition, dataset contains over 600,000 labeled digits cropped from street-level photos. It has been used in neural networks created by Google to improve the map quality by automatically transcribing the address numbers from a patch of pixels. The transcribed number with a known street address helps pinpoint the location of the building it represents.

<b>Objective:</b>
To build an artificial feed-forward neural network model and a convolutional neural network that can recognize the digits in the images.


## <a href="https://github.com/krishnapatury/DataScience/blob/main/Classification_DecisionTrees_RandomForest.ipynb" rel="nofollow">Predicting Potential Customers</a> 
The Online Education market would be worth $286.62bn by 2023, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.26% from 2018 to 2023. With the availability and ease of use of digital marketing resources, companies can reach a wider audience with their offerings and nurture these leads to convert them to paid customers. ExtraaLearn is an initial-stage startup that offers programs on cutting-edge technologies to students and professionals to help them upskill/reskill. With a large number of leads generated regularly, one of the issues faced by ExtraaLearn is to identify which customers are more likely to convert so that they can allocate the resources accordingly. 

<b>Objective:</b>
The goal is to analyze and build an ML model to create a profile of leads more likely to convert to paid customers by identifying the factors driving the lead conversion.


## <a href="https://github.com/krishnapatury/DataScience/blob/main/Pima_Indians_Diabetes_Analysis.ipynb" rel="nofollow">Diabetes Exploratory Data Analysis</a>

Diabetes is one of the most frequent diseases worldwide and the number of diabetic patients are growing over the years. The main cause of diabetes remains unknown, yet scientists believe that both genetic factors and environmental lifestyle play a major role in diabetes.

A few years ago research was done on a tribe in America which is called the Pima tribe (also known as the Pima Indians). In this tribe, it was found that the ladies are prone to diabetes very early. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients were females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

<b>Objective:</b>
Exploratory Data Analysis to understand different aspects of Diabetes in the Pima Indians tribe.
